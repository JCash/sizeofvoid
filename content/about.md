# Who am I

My name is Mathias Westerdahl, and I currently live in Stockholm, Sweden.

I'm co-founder of [Refold](https:/www.refold.io) where I am also working as a game engine developer.
I am also a board member of the [Defold Foundation](https://defold.com/foundation/).

I've worked with programming games and game engines since 2001, when I started as a physics programmer at UDS, in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden.
After that I spent 11 years making build systems, tools, and game logic at Avalanche Studios, bot in Stockholm and in New York.

For the past 5 years I've been working with the [Defold game engine](https:/www.defold.com).
